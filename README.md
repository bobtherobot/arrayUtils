# arrayUtils

a couple common array utils

### naturalCompare
The most reliable natural sort method out there in the wild was written by someone from another dimension, and difficult to wrap my head around.

So I re-wrote it using human readable code and demystified it.


### sortOn
An often used method that I always seem to lose, putting here as a single source of truth for myself (and you!)

sortOn has naturalCompare embedded within.

### keep it simple
These are sold "as is" and can easily be converted to modules or just copy and paste.

Minified versions are there for the taking too.
